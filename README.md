Congrats on submitting your first pass at lessons. It probably wasn't easy and you might have found yourself going back to this curriculum guide for help along the way. 

You've submitted your PRs and you get them back with plenty of feedback and comments. What now? 

Go through the comments. Some you'll notice will be positive- so good job! The rest will be questions and areas that you will either need to fix, expand, or clarify on more. Sometimes at the very end of a PR, you'll see an overall summary comment that highlights the main things addressed in the various smaller comments throughout. 

Update your wip-branch based on the comments. You can either do this on Github itself or locally and then push the new branch up. If you do it locally, you don't need to create a new PR since the wip-branch will automatically update in the existing PR. 

As you're updating the lesson based on the comments, let us know that you're doing so by adding a note right below the ones we've added. Below any comment, you'll see an option to "Add an inline note." Click on that and just add a comment that says "Fixed" or "Addressed." 

Sometimes you might disagree with some of the suggestions we raised. If that's the case, then just respond in an inline note and also remember to email us as well specifically on this. 

When you're all done updating, @mention AnnJohn in the PR and let us know that it's ready for another review.
